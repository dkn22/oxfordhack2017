Most of the Steelers sat out the national anthem on Sunday, after President Trump expressed an opinion on what players should do during the anthem. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, “We’re not going to play politics.” That is, however, impossible.



Everything is political, and it always has been. Politics is what the government does, and what opinions people have about what the government should do. Politics dictates what you can do and say, and what options you have in living your life. As they say, the personal is political.

Your ability to afford health insurance and to access care (or not) is political, in the sense that it was shaped by the actions or inactions of a government. The fact that hepatitis A is raging in the streets of San Diego is political. The fact that police kill unarmed black men at an alarming rate—and, indeed, the entire way that police and prisons and the criminal justice system operate—is political. Being able to marry the person you love is political. Fearing that they will be deported is political. Thanks to weakened safety regulations and climate-change denial, even hurricanes these days are political.



The fact that we go to war, and hang flags, and sing anthems and honor soldiers is political.

One Steelers player, Alejandro Villanueva, went on the field and stood for the anthem anyway. He is a veteran who has reportedly said that honoring service members by standing for the flag is more important than protesting against racial injustice. That is a very political statement.

Where do we get this idea that it’s possible to avoid making political statements? Well, if the police don’t spend much time in your mostly white suburb, protests of police violence are a spectator sport you can choose not to watch. If you can’t get pregnant, access to birth control and abortion is something you can ignore. If you don’t know any undocumented people, DACA seems like a political football with no relevance to your life. The only way to pretend that something is “not political” is to not have a stake in it."

Sometimes certain words and phrases bubble up in the right-wing word cloud—Jeremiah Wright, birth certificate, Vince Foster, Kenya, Benghazi. The latest to surge to the front is “Uranium One,” the latest story on alleged Clintonian malfeasance to make headlines on both right-wing and mainstream media.



A quick primer: A Russian company, Rosatom, acquired a majority stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company with rights to mine U.S. uranium, in 2010, and bought the rest in 2013. As the Associated Press explains:

“Because Uranium One had holdings in American uranium mines, which at the time accounted for about 20 percent of America’s licensed uranium mining capacity, Rosatom’s 2010 purchase had to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That committee, known as CFIUS, is made up of officials from nine federal agencies, including the State Department, which [Secretary] Clinton ran at the time.”

President Trump, mired in his own Russia scandal, has recently made this an issue, raising questions about some kind of quid pro quo deal, as people associated with Uranium One had donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. The connection was first noted in a book by Peter Schweizer, who frequently collaborates on films and books with Steve Bannon of Breitbart News.



So Why Now? And Is There Anything to This?

On Monday, the Justice Department said prosecutors were investigating whether a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into the Uranium One deal and ties to the Clinton Foundation. This appears to be a response to the president’s statement that Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, should be investigating the Clintons and the Obama administration.

This is troubling for several reasons—the first of which is that presidents are not supposed to use their platform to punish political rivals. Secondly, as the Times notes: “Any such investigation would raise questions about the independence of federal investigations under Mr. Trump. Since Watergate, the Justice Department has largely operated independently of political influence on cases related to the president’s opponents.” The third issue—and this is the kicker—is that the F.B.I. investigated the Clinton Foundation in 2015, and did not uncover enough evidence to mount a case.

The story has a strong, strong whiff of distraction—if the media is once more whipped up about Secretary Clinton, perhaps it will devote less air time to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russian in the 2016 election, an investigation that issued its first indictments two weeks ago.

To say that the current administration has been pushing extremely harsh immigration policies would be putting it mildly. Trump even went so far as to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was intended to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. The country has experienced sweeping raids that have imperiled many, and as such, American cities are now working together to protect people from dangerous federal policies.

The Vera Institute of Justice has just awarded grant money to support an enterprise called the SAFE Cities Network. Cities in eight states have banded together to build a fund that will pay for legal representation for immigrants facing deportation. All cities in the network had to apply to the Vera Institute with a proposal to prove they are committed to spending public dollars on deportation defense, which will then be matched by the institute.

In conjunction with the announcement of the SAFE Cities Network, the Vera Institute released a new study that shows having access to a lawyer makes all the difference when it comes to keeping families together. The study highlights the “common misperception” that only illegal immigrants face deportation proceedings; in reality, many people are vulnerable to being thrust into the deeply complicated world of immigration law:



In fact, any non-citizen—including lawful permanent residents (green card holders), refugees, and people who entered legally on visas can be placed in deportation proceedings.

And to put some numbers to it, the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project reported that only 4% of cases had a “successful outcome” without an attorney. The NYUFUP has worked to get universal access to representation for immigration cases, and since implementing that measure, has seen a 48% successful outcome rate, which is an 1100% increase.

As of now, this is the list of cities in the SAFE network:

Atlanta GA



Austin TX



Baltimore MD



Chicago IL



Columbus OH



Dane County WI



Oakland/Alameda County CA



Prince George’s County MD



Sacramento CA



San Antonio TX



Santa Ana CA



The Baltimore Sun reports that Mayor Catherine Pugh announced Baltimore’s participation in SAFE Cities in a statement that emphasizes how providing adequate legal representation makes all members of a community safer:

“Our community is safest when our neighbors trust their officials and institutions and know they will be treated justly and with dignity,” Pugh said in a news release. “Providing legal representation to those facing deportation maintains trust in law enforcement and our local institutions and keeps us all safe. If our residents don’t feel safe – for example, coming forward to report crimes and cooperating with law enforcement – all of us are at more risk.”

SAFE Cities will ensure that anyone who meets their financial eligibility requirement receives a lawyer during deportation hearings, as long as they are within one of those districts associated with the network. It isn’t immediately clear how lawyers will be connected with the people who need them, but the Vera Institute writes that they will “provide technical expertise and support, including assistance in identifying and training legal service providers, providing opportunities to share best practices with other jurisdictions, and providing data collection and analyses for the purpose of evaluating the network’s impact.”

On Sunday, Hill had tweeted:



CNN’s statement on her suspension references her September tweet calling President Trump a white supremacist:

Her suspension raises some questions, specifically about whether ESPN is within its rights to discipline an employee for speaking out on social media about political issues—albeit political issues that intersect with corporate interests.

Advertisement

“The baseline is that you don’t have First Amendment protections in private-sector employment,” says David Wachtel, an attorney at Trister, Ross, Schadler & Gold in Washington. “You can be fired for activity on social media.”

However, he notes that companies should have social media policies in place that are part of employee handbooks—so if you are speaking out on Twitter but still in compliance with the specifics of the policy, you may have a case for breach of contract if you’re fired. (Whether you have the stomach for that is another matter.)

“Social media policies usually include something like ‘You don’t say you speak for us unless we say you speak for us.’ That’s what the Hill blow-up was the first time around. And they may also say you can’t say anything that hurts the business—and ESPN may say if you’re saying ‘boycott sponsors,’ you’re saying ‘boycott ESPN,’” says Wachtel.

In September, after the white supremacist tweet, the New York Times ran a story on a Connecticut statute (ESPN is based in Bristol, Connecticut) that “provides free-speech protections beyond the First Amendment, making it illegal for ESPN to punish Hill, according to some labor lawyers.” It also notes that ESPN has encouraged its hosts to comment provocatively on cultural issues.

However, the statute offers a caveat: “Provided such activity does not substantially or materially interfere with the employee’s bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and the employee.” An argument can be made that Hill’s tweet does substantially interfere.

So what can an employee do to protect herself (besides not speaking publicly on any cultural or political matters at all?) Wachtel says: “You can protect yourself by following the social-media policy. If the policy allows you to [speak freely], you may have a couple of different legal arguments [if you’re disciplined], like breach of contract. The best inoculation is to follow social media policy like it’s a contract.”

So there’s no predicting if Jemele Hill will keep a lid on her political opinions, now that she’s been suspended. For some employees, the right to speak freely about pressing matters of public concern might be more valuable than a job."

In general, people take jobs to make money. But if you work for the White House, you have to be prepared for the possibility that, down the road, you might eventually need to lawyer up. And that can get...expensive. Like, half a million dollars expensive, according to Bloomberg Politics. Writer Shannon Pettypiece reports on the tale of Michael Caputo, who spent four months as Trump’s campaign chair and now has $30,000 in legal bills to show for it. Now, legal fees might not be so crippling if you can use your campaign funds to pay them, as President Trump is reportedly doing, but what if you’re a lowly administrative assistant? You could, theoretically, be forced to tap your kid’s college fund or your retirement savings.



To get an idea of better how to protect yourself financially when you’re under investigation, I spoke to Matt Kaiser, a former federal public defender and partner at KaiserDillon in Washington, D.C.

Insurance

FEDS offers insurance to federal employees in the event they need to cover legal fees. “It generally won’t cover you if you’re indicted,” says Kaiser, “but it will take care of you if there’s an investigation like the one we’re seeing now.” If you are insured, the insurance company will likely want to select the lawyer representing you, “so you do lose some flexibility there,” says Kaiser.

Keep Calm and Comparison Shop

“Some people freak out and hire the biggest name they can find, and that winds up not being cheap,” says Kaiser. His firm represented some of the people caught up in the Lois Lerner IRS investigation, and he notes that some of the IRS employees hired the really big law firms, “and they ended up spending north of $100,000,” he says. “Our clients hired us. We have a different rate structure. Of course, it ended up being more money than they wanted, but we’re talking a couple of vacations versus your retirement savings.”

Advertisement

Also remember that in these kinds of situations, there might be 50 people under investigation, but only 10-15 are going to incur major expenses. For everyone else, it’s an interview or two. You need representation, but it’s not necessarily going to break the bank.

Use Campaign Funds

This is how Trump is reportedly dealing with his legal fees from the Russia probe. How those funds are used is at the discretion of the campaign chair—though Kaiser notes that there might not be much practical difference between the wishes of the candidate and the wishes of the campaign chair. So when you decide to go to work for Candidate X, “you’re betting that they’re such a good guy or such a good woman that they’ll help you out.”

Set Up a Legal Defense Fund

The Clintons established a legal defense fund, as did Scooter Libby, to pay their legal bills (which in Libby’s case reportedly reached into the millions of dollars). But if you’re not a higher-up or a big name—or have big names pulling for you—this might not get you very far.

Ask Your Employer

“This is more in the case of someone, for example, in a lobbying shop,” says Kaiser. “Sometimes an employer will have your back and pay your fees. Don’t be shy about asking your employer to pay.” The advantage to this scenario is that is the employer is paying, the various defense lawyers can cooperate: “We’re strategic about what we talk about, but we need to find what the government is asking for. And if the employer is paying, usually all the attorneys are good, sophisticated lawyers.”

What You Can’t Do

Don’t bother putting all your assets in a trust or an LLC or anything like that before you go to work for, say, a member of Congress. “Making yourself look impoverished is not going to help you,” says Kaiser. “Lawyers do focus on whether you can pay them.”"

Back in October when the president signed an executive order about birth control coverage, we thought—and he probably thought—that it would allow religious employers to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees. Notre Dame thought that too. But it appears all of us were wrong.



It seems to have gone like this. Notre Dame is a Catholic university, and holds the position that birth control is wrong and bad. (Religions are weird, okay?) Federal law—the ACA—requires that insurance plans cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost. But Notre Dame said, we don’t want to provide birth control for our employees.

Advertisement

During the Obama administration, the federal government said, fine, we’ll pay for birth control—all that religious employers have to do is file a waiver saying they aren’t going to pay for it. The government will step in and pick up the tab.

But some employers said that even filing that waiver—which Notre Dame did—was still wrong because it caused birth control to be provided to employees. This case went to the Supreme Court, and didn’t get resolved. Then the executive order seemed to end the argument: employers could choose not to pay for birth control coverage, and their employees wouldn’t get birth control, and that was that. Notre Dame sent a letter to its employees and students, giving the required 60 days notice that birth control coverage would be ending.

But.

Aetna, which provides Notre Dame’s insurance, isn’t changing their plans. They’re just picking up the bill themselves.

Advertisement

I asked Aetna if the reason they’re covering the cost is to comply with the law, which may arguably require them to still cover birth control at no cost, or because it’s a no-brainer that if you cover maternity care, birth control reduces the number of births you have to pay for. A spokesperson told me she would not answer questions about their arrangement with Notre Dame. (Notre Dame didn’t return my calls.)

In any case, there may be nothing the university can do about it. A Notre Dame spokesperson told the South Bend Tribune that after the executive order, “we believed that insurance companies would discontinue no cost coverage … Since then, we have been informed that [our insurance company] will continue such coverage indefinitely.”

The statement also says the university “will not interfere” with the insurance company’s coverage, although it’s unclear whether there’s any way they could. So it’s possible that—depending on your insurer—the executive order doesn’t give religious employers the power they thought it did."

President Trump’s campaign chairmen, Paul Manafort, was indicted Monday morning and ordered to surrender to authorities. According to the New York Times, he is charged with funneling “millions of dollars through overseas shell companies and [using] the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, antiques and expensive suits.” His associate Rick Gates was also charged. The Times notes that this represents “a significant escalation in a special counsel investigation that has cast a shadow over Mr. Trump’s first year in office.”

What exactly does this mean—what is an indictment, what does it mean to surrender, and what are Manafort’s next steps? And how does this tie into Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation of the Trump campaign for its possible ties to Russia? I spoke to Matt Kaiser, a former federal public defender and partner at KaiserDillon in Washington, D.C.

What is an indictment?

“The Constitution requires that if anyone is to be charged with a felony in federal court, they must be charged by a grand jury. That means that members of the community come together to hear evidence and see if there is probable cause that the person committed the charges presented to them. The person is still presumed not guilty. The indictment is the formal charging document in which the government sets out the charges and starts the process of the criminal case.”

What happens when a person is indicted?

“Either they self-surrender [as in the case of Manfort] or an arrest warrant is issued. Most federal courts have an initial appearance the same day, unless the indictment comes down late at night. At that hearing, the judge does a few things: He or she will formally tells you what the charges are. You’ll get a copy of the indictment, they’ll make sure you’ve got a lawyer (not an issue in this case), and then they’ll decide what the conditions of your release are.”

Who’s the judge?

Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee. Before she was a judge she was a defense attorney who represented William Jefferson, the Louisiana congressmen convicted in 2009 on corruption charges. “She will quickly issue a scheduling order which will say when motions are due and when trial is set to be.”

What’s the first thing to look for?

“First thing to watch for is the speed with which this case moves—whether the government pushes for a speedy trial or whether it will take some time to try. Mueller personally signed the indictment. I don’t think that’s a big tactical signal, but it’s an interesting thing to note.”

What should we watch out for, in terms of strategy?

“White collar cases like this have started adopting mob or big drug case strategies—indicting lower level people to pressure them to flip. I have to think that this is the strategy here. It’s a big indictment with a lot of charges, and the maximum penalty is massive. Manafort is going to have a difficult choice: Go to trial? Or can he cooperate against the president or the other people that Mueller is trying to get?”

Do you think he’ll take the fall, a la Scooter Libby?

I asked Kaiser about Scooter Libby’s conviction, in which he was sentenced to 30 months for perjury and obstruction of justice in the Valerie Plame case. GOPers raised $5 million for his defense, and his sentence was later commuted. Agreeing to take the fall for higher-ups—if that’s indeed what happened—would have required a certain level of trust on Libby’s part. Does Kaiser think that this case is similar?

“That’s a really interesting question: Is Donald Trump trustworthy? I have to think that lot of people would have reason to be skeptical. It’s a huge risk. Mueller’s not going away.”"

Life is competition, and it’s especially easy to feel like you’re losing if your coworkers are always taking bomb-ass vacations while you sit at home using a Netflix account you split with four other people.



We all have colleagues whose Instagram accounts inspire a hot spike of rage as you look with indignation at their sunset pictures of Dubrovnik and think, “Weren’t you JUST in Iceland last month??”

Advertisement

Social media makes it incredibly easy to build up a deep and powerful reservoir of resentment at your colleagues’ vacations, either because you can’t quite figure out the discrepancy between the numbers on your paycheck and the lavish lifestyle they seem to be living, or maybe just because they’re actually good at planning things.

The obvious solution to this resentment is to ignite class war that overthrows the bourgeoisie and seizes all their extravagant capital to socialize plane tickets from here out. But, more practically, you could probably just get over it, because their life is likely not as peachy as it seems.

To cope with this very real form of simmering office resentment, we talked to a few experts who shared tips about suppressing, harnessing or counteracting your resentment at your vacationing colleagues. It’s also a good reminder that basically everyone is more miserable than they seem.

Identify the source of your resentment

First things first, narrow down your resentment and figure out what you’re actually upset about. Are you angry that someone seems to make more money than you even though you have the same dang job? Are you mad that they have a better job that you’re probably just as qualified for? Or are you just upset because while your coworker probably makes the same salary as you and is offered the same amount of vacation days, but they seem to be better able to manage their time and budgeting so they can fit in the lavish-looking trip to Portugal while you’re trying to fit in two hours to go pickup a UPS package on North Brother Island?

Advertisement

That last one is more mundane and easier to cope with, but they are all manageable enough once you compartmentalize your resentment and tackle the problem from there.

“More or less, people understand that salaries differ throughout offices dependending on job responsibilities,” said Alison Green, author of the Ask a Manager workplace column. “More of what I see is people who just feel crushed by their workload who feel like they can never find time to take a real vacation.”

Finding the time

If all things are equal—as in, if you and the target of your envy have similar jobs and compensation—you probably just need to get better at planning.

Part of the problem may be our American addiction to overworking, the feeling that if you use your vacation days, you’ll come off as weak and fungible, like a Trump cabinet member. That’s usually not the case, Green said. Talking to your boss can be a first step toward helping you carve out time and mentally allowing yourself have a vacation. After all, an overworked employee is probably more of a detriment to your workplace than one who occasionally screws off to New Orleans for a week or two every year.

“Sometimes people feel like talking to their boss won’t do any good, they feel like ‘I’m indispensable, no one can cover my work I’m when gone,” she said. “Honestly, a lot of the times when I see that, the boss doesn’t feel that way. If the person would just say, ‘hey this is important to me, can we figure out a way to make this work?’ the manager will help them.”

In America, especially in a high-octane environment like New York City or Silicon Valley, it can be easy to misinterpret the idea of taking time off of work with not being a team player. But in actuality, Green said, we get vacation days for a reason—to go on vacation.

“It is a real thing in some offices, if you use all of your vacation days, people will look askance at that,” she said. “Which is of course ridiculous. They shouldn’t give you all those vacation days if you’re not intended to use them.” Even if you might get the side-eye from your fellow overworked colleagues or even a manager, you should make the most of the vacation days to which you’re legally entitled.

If fairness is the issue

It’s totally possible that your perceived injustice about the travel gap between you and your coworkers is, in fact, an actual injustice. Workplace imbalances of pay or compensation can be real wellsprings of strife among employees, another way capitalism turns us all against each other in a never-ending blood sport. But even athletes in blood sports get bye weeks!

“If it truly does seem unfair, you may want to take stock of your own job,” said Ryan Howes, a psychologist from Pasadena, California. “Do you need to ask for a raise or more vacation time? Do you think your work is unfairly biased against you, meaning you may need to speak to a lawyer or recruiter?”

(As it happens, we have numerous guides that can help you assert for compensation equality in the workplace, from what to do when you think you’re underpaid to how to ask for a raise to just how to ask for more time off.)

Advertisement

Remember that rarely is someone going to come around and demand you take a vacation, or insist that your pay be brought up to par with your coworkers who are at the same level. You’ve got to ask for it.

Similarly, if the issue is that an unfair amount of work is getting foisted on you every time a colleague goes out of town, instead of stewing about it, talk to a manager about ways you can improve protocols for vacation prep, and mitigate the situation the next time around.

Just avoid talking about it

If following all your coworkers on social media is just going to inspire fits of class warfare rage, Green advises that it’s probably best to just unfollow them.

Workplace conversations about their vacations are harder to avoid without seeming rude; but Green said that they come with their own built-in escape hatch.

“You can say, ‘I’ve got to get back to work, I’m on deadline,’” she said.

If you really can’t avoid it, consider drafting the person into helping you plan one of those famous exciting vacations they’re apparently angling to become known for.

“If you can’t beat ‘em, make them your travel agent,” Howes said.

Remember that everyone is miserable

Everyone’s life seems magical on social media, or full of carefree wonder when recounting how this trip to Brazil was better than the last one as you’re sitting around the office Keurig machine. But no matter how shiny someone’s life looks online, remember that Donald Trump is still president, none of us will ever be able to afford to retire, we’re all one minor hospital visit away from crippling debt and everyone is secretly screaming on the inside. Or, more to the point, everyone has their own private struggles and difficulties, most of which they’re probably not wearing on their sleeve to mitigate your feelings about the good things that do come their way. So your jealousy is almost certainly misplaced.

“Social media is the place where people highlight how great their life can appear, but it rarely represents the totality of their life,” Howes tells us. “Insecurity, shame, failure and loss are often more common (and even more meaningful) than those happy moments, but they rarely make it onto your feed. Try to accept that your normal doesn’t have to equal someone else’s best take.”

Just as it is foolish to comment on anything about someone’s life—from their medical conditions to their sobriety—without knowing them well enough, it’s dangerous to assume you actually know why someone can travel that much without asking them, Green said.

“Maybe the reason they’re able to afford fantastic vacations is they’re up to their eyeballs in credit card debt,” she said.

She recalled a friend who went on an amazing vacation with her whole family—but only because her parent had terminal cancer, and they wanted to take one last vacation.

“You never know what the story is,” she said. “Sometimes things are not as perfect and shiny as they appear on the outside.”

The best solution? Handle your own business, and put things in perspective. “If it’s about envy,” Howes said, “your negative feelings about their happiness are really rooted in your dissatisfaction with your own life.”"

Every year, on the second Monday of October, the U.S. celebrates Columbus Day, which commemorates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas on October 12, 1492. Yet he sailed for the Spanish, landed in the Caribbean, and was kind of a jerk. So, uh, why is this a U.S. holiday again?

First, a brief history lesson. Columbus, a Genoese explorer, was sailing under the Spanish flag in hopes of colonizing the “new world.” After crossing the Atlantic in search of the fabled East Indies, which was certainly no easy feat at that time, he landed on the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) instead of Japan or some other part of Southeast Asia as intended. While there, he set up a colony, kicked off the transatlantic slave trade, forced locals to work in a gold mine or have their hands chopped off, most likely committed genocide of Hispaniola natives (don’t worry, he did some jail time), and did so all in the name of Christianity. Oh, and he’s also probably the reason indigenous people were referred to as “Indians” back then and are still called that to this day. Stand-up fella.

Columbus landing in Hispaniola. John Vanderlyn (1847).

So why in the world would the U.S. want to turn such a figure into some sort of national hero? Well, I’ll give you three reasons. For one, despite his methods, he did help establish transatlantic trade routes that eventually led to more colonization, which eventually led to the forming of our country. It’s hard to say for certain, but the world could have been very different if Columbus hadn’t succeeded. Second, several U.S. presidents greatly romanticized the “Columbus discovering the New World” myth, including Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who instituted the federal holiday in 1937, and Benjamin Harrison, who called upon U.S. citizens to celebrate the 400th anniversary in 1892. Let’s be clear: Columbus did not discover America. People were already here, and if you’re going to credit a European with discovery, it should be the Viking explorer Leif Erikson (who beat Columbus by a few hundred years).

But lastly, and most importantly, we celebrate Columbus Day because—drum roll please—we hated the English! Remember how Columbus landed in the Caribbean and not mainland North America? Well, there was another explorer—a Venetian by the name of John Cabot—who did land on the mainland in 1497, “discovering” the North American coast for the first time since the 11th century. So why aren’t we celebrating John Cabot day every year? Simple—Cabot sailed under the English flag.

Both Columbus and Cabot were largely minor characters of history for hundreds of years after their deaths, but fast forward to the newly independent American colonies in 1776 and things have changed. As Brian Handwerk at Smithsonian Magazine explains, American colonists needed a “heroic symbol” for their newly born nation. In hindsight, Cabot should have been the obvious choice—he landed where their new nation actually is and he didn’t mass murder the natives. In fact, he didn’t even make contact with them, not advancing “beyond the shooting distance of a crossbow” when he made landfall. But as Handwerk puts it, Cabot sailed under an inconvenient flag. Nobody in the newly independent United States wanted to associate themselves with an explorer who worked for the British.



So that’s why the U.S. has celebrated Columbus since the late 18th century (there was a big celebration as far back as 1792 for the 300th anniversary), and why it became a state holiday in Colorado in 1905 before becoming a federal holiday in 1937. These days, however, many cities choose to celebrate Indigenous People’s Day on the second Monday of October instead. More than 60 cities around the country opt for a counter-celebration which promotes Native American culture and history."

During a hearing on October 12th, experts warned the U.S. House of Representatives that an EMP bomb, likely from North Korea, could kill as many as 90% of all Americans within a year. But what is an EMP bomb? And could such a weapon really be that devastating?

What Is EMP?

EMP stands for electromagnetic pulse, which is considered a short burst of electromagnetic radiation. This kind of burst can come from a variety of sources, including our own sun, but in this case we’re talking about a pulse from a nuclear detonation that occurs at an extremely high altitude.

When a nuclear explosion occurs in space above a target, three types of electromagnetic pulses follow: E1, E2, and E3. An E1 pulse involves high-energy gamma rays colliding with air molecules nearly 20 miles above, then raining down electrons that get pulled in by Earth’s natural magnetic field. An E2 pulse comes from high-energy neutrons that get fired in every direction, and an E3 pulse occurs due to the size of the nuclear fireball itself affecting the Earth’s magnetic field. As nuclear physicist Dr. Yousaf Butt explains, these pulses affect everything in line of sight of the nuclear blast. For example, a blast at 60 miles up can affect a 700-mile radius on Earth. However, there is a “safe space” that is unaffected by all three pulses almost directly below the blast thanks to the Earth’s magnetic field.

What Can It Do?

EMP bombs do not cause casualties directly. The blast happens much too far away from people. Their power comes from interfering, disrupting, or damaging electronic equipment. That could mean power grids going down, cars and planes losing power, computer systems going berserk, and possibly even losing emergency backup power at facilities like hospitals. It sounds pretty scary, and EMP blasts are a significant threat, but the effects are largely untested and exaggerated through pop culture and inflammatory claims by politicians.

Still, we are certain about some aspects of nuclear-based EMP detonations. According to Butt, each of the three different types of pulse—E1, E2, and E3—affect various types of electrical systems in different ways. E1 affects local antennas, short cable runs, equipment inside buildings, integrated circuits, sensors, communication systems, protective systems, and computers; E2 is similar to a lightning strike (so not as damaging since we know how to deal with it), and affects longer conductive lines, vertical antenna towers, and aircraft with trailing wire antennas; and E3 affects power lines and long communications lines like undersea and underground cables, which could wreak havoc on commercial power and landlines. Overall, most of the damage would come from E1 and E3 pulses disrupting the technology we’ve come to rely on. Post-blast, generators may be able to still provide power, but for the most part, people would not have access to electricity. This could be devastating, or it could be extremely inconvenient until it’s fixed—it’s all speculation.

Should You Be Worried?

An EMP attack on the U.S. by North Korea is probably more likely than a direct nuclear ICBM attack. Why? An EMP bomb requires a heck of a lot less accuracy to be effective. As long as it goes off somewhere above us they’ve sunk our battleship, so to speak. And high-altitude ICBMs are difficult to stop compared to those that come in lower, like ground-based nuclear attacks. Our Ground-based Midcourse Defense missile system (GMD) is capable of reaching into space, but other systems like THAAD or Aegis would have a much harder time.

But again, the specifics of EMP bombs and what would happen post-blast are still up in the air, and, for the most part, exaggerated. In 1962, the STARFISH PRIME weapons test—which involved firing a 1.4 megaton nuke 250 miles above the Pacific—caused quite a commotion. Electromagnetic surges traveled as far as Hawaii, around 900 miles away, causing damage to some telephone company equipment, making streetlights flicker, and even messing with people’s garage doors (they started to open and close by themselves). But there were no power outages, the phone lines stayed up, and there was no radio interference throughout the entire event.

In another example, the EMP Commission tested the effects of electromagnetic pulses on 37 cars and 18 trucks in a laboratory environment. Jeffrey Lewis at Foreign Policy explains:

While EMP advocates claim the results of an EMP attack would be “planes falling from the sky, cars stalling on the roadways, electrical networks failing, food rotting,” the actual results were much more modest. Of the 55 vehicles exposed to EMP, six at the highest levels of exposure needed to be restarted. A few more showed “nuisance” damage to electronics, such as blinking dashboard displays.

So, that claim that an EMP bomb would kill off 90% of Americans is almost certainly total bullshit. For one, Kyle Mizokami at Popular Mechanics points out that the source of that information is a quote from Congressman Roscoe Bartlett describing a science-fiction novel he had read called One Second After—not real data of any kind. Also, Bartlett was so freaked out by the idea of the nation’s power grid going down, he went off the grid to live off the land. Not exactly a reliable source of information to say the least. The truth is, nobody really knows if an EMP bomb could take out the nation’s power grid, or how large of a bomb would be necessary to accomplish such a feat, and at what altitude. Even if North Korea were to strike, it’s unlikely they’d have a weapon large enough to send us back to the stone age. And they’d most certainly only get one shot to do so...

That said, we are still somewhat vulnerable, and we now lack an official way to prepare for such an attack. On September 30th of this year, the Trump administration shut down the Congressional Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse after it had been in operation for over 16 years. Members of the former commission, including Dr. William R. Graham and Dr. Peter Vincent Pry, have been trying to appeal to the administration to get things back on track. They suggest the U.S.’s infrastructure is not prepared for an EMP attack, and believe U.S. intelligence has been underestimating North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. After all, it is possible to protect against such attacks, but the costs for such a shield would be in the billions and likely take years to implement. For now, rest easy knowing an EMP strike would not kill 90% of the people in the country."

The more refined definition comes from the fishing technique of trolling (dragging a fishhook behind a boat) and is a synonym for trickster. This type of troll knowingly strings others along, often by aggravating them, by pretending to take a ridiculous attitude or position. Ideally, they cause no harm, other than what the target inflicts upon themselves. Trickster trolling is a skill—a skill I will teach you.



And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. Matthew 4:19

The looser definition of troll, increasingly popular because people are afraid to say “bully,” refers to people who are just shitty online—like ugly bridge trolls. Their “trolling” takes the form of harassment, threats, insults, or simply annoying behavior. Some of these trolls think they’re the trickster kind; others don’t even realize how aggravating or offensive they’re being. Either way, bully trolls are the best target for the trickster trolls.

When someone frustrates or offends you online, it can be tempting to respond with your own vitriol. Sometimes this is an appropriate reaction! But sometimes you’re just letting this person ruin your day and encouraging them to ruin it further. Instead you can run circles around them, to the delight of yourself and others. Handled right, trickster trolling is a great way to relieve the pain of bully trolling. It helps you re-cast yourself from victim to empowered jokester who is not to be fucked with.

Put on a Friendly Face

Trickster trolling is like comedic acting. The beauty of the troll lies in the gap between the character and the actor. If your aim is to frustrate your target, you should present yourself as helpful and cooperative. This sometimes wins the troll over, which can leave everyone feeling happy. But often the troll just digs deeper, exposing themselves

Advertisement

The faux helpfulness also an act of self-care; you’re building a buffer between yourself and the hate you want to direct back at your troll—but you’re not actually accepting their behavior on their terms. Most importantly, it’s fun as hell.

Play to the Audience

There’s a spectrum, not a dark line, between trickster trolling and bully trolling. One way to make sure you’re on the right side is to keep in mind what a third party would think. In fact, if you can, do your trolling in public, where you’re staying more mindful of your behavior. Third-party reactions will help you determine whether your trolling is ethical, and when it’s time to stop.

If your trolling pokes at widespread annoyances or bigotry, making it public can help others. Coder and satirist Jen Schiffer, in her impeccable how-to presentation on trolling and satire, gives examples of women in tech who were deeply satisfied to see self-important men fall for her jokes. By playing to an audience, Schiffer exposed the sexism of these men, who couldn’t grasp the concept of a smart and funny woman playing a joke. Some of these men managed to recognize their sexism and, hopefully, improve themselves.

Always Give Them an Out

If you’re trolling a troll, they’ve usually made the first move. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you can go nuclear. Sometimes you should—Nazis need punching! But if someone is just being kind of a dick, you’ll probably feel better if you switch things up on them, rather than responding at their level of energy and vitriol. The process should take less out of you than it takes out of them. (This doesn’t mean you can’t put effort into it; if you’re running an extensive Photoshop troll, but the work energizes you, go for it.)

Give your troll an out—some way they could stop engaging. This is another way to ensure you don’t become the bad guy. There’s usually no benefit to harassing your harasser when they’ve already abandoned the fight, and it’s not a good look.

Recently, a Lifehacker reader emailed me, demanding I give up my “entire fucking career as a writer” because he didn’t like my photo choice on an article. “You’ll find out your career isn’t the only thing you could lose,” he wrote under his full name, calling me “another self-impressed white boy trying to virtue signal” before blaming me for the Trump presidency.

While I knew that good-faith discussion would be fruitless, I was interested to hear more, so I responded in an appropriate length: one character, lower-case.

He replied, at the length to which he is accustomed. I replied, at mine. After three iterations, he realized he didn’t actually have to reply, and took his out.



Never Let Them See You Bleed

Trolling a troll is, at its heart, a game of who could care less. If you actually care more, you should consider a different approach. If you work extremely hard to demonstrate that you care less, maybe you actually care more. You don’t want to look like the guy in the classic rage comic:

You don’t have to have the last word. Sometimes you actively don’t want to. Do I wish I hadn’t sent that final “k” email? Absolutely, and in admitting so, I have now retroactively lost that fight. Troll-on-troll combat is not a boxing match; it’s a game of hot potato. The last man standing loses.

The term sprezzatura may or may not apply here, but it’s Italian and I want to use it, so let’s say it does. Sprezzatura is a studied carelessness, the kind the trickster troll strives for. To succeed at sprezzatura is to convince everyone that all this really is a joke to you, while it’s deadly serious to your would-be bully.

But you can only show, not tell, sprezzatura. The more you try to prove that you don’t care, the less convincing you’ll be. As literal professional trolls Felix Biederman and Virgil Texas put it, “One way to assert authority when you’re mad is to say this entire time you’ve merely been pretending to be terrible, perhaps as a social experiment or for your own amusement.”

This caring-about-not-caring might sound exhausting to you. If so, be free! Block and report your trolls! But if you enjoy it, troll-trolling can be a rewarding and calming hobby, like building model airplanes: crafting little simulations of actual conflict, in your basement, until you get high off the fumes.

Davy Crockett is an American folk hero of mythic proportions, and was greatly popularized during the 50s and 60s thanks to Disney’s TV miniseries and major motion pictures. But Crockett was a very real person in history, and he had a lot of wisdom to share.



Welcome to Retro Week, where we’ll be firing up the flux capacitor and bringing you 1950s know-how on everything from casserole-making to fallout-shelter-building to the joys of letting kids relax and play with trash.

The intro to Disney’s Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955)

David “Davy” Crockett was born in 1786 (pre-U.S. Constitution) and lived as a runaway, soldier, frontiersman, and was even elected to Congress in 1825 after serving in the Tennessee state legislature since 1821. He was certainly famous while he lived, but plays, songs, and tall tales transformed him into the coonskin-hat-wearing certified folk hero we know him as today.

On Government and Sticking to His Guns

While he was in Congress, Crockett opposed most of President Andrew Jackson’s policies, including the Indian Removal Act, which sought to relocate all Native Americans west of the Mississippi River. But Crockett’s strong opposition and refusal to do the bidding of any political parties eventually led to a troubled political career. He had a lot to say about those who act as political puppets:

“I would rather be beaten, and be a man, than to be elected and be a little puppy dog. I have always supported measures and principles and not men...” In a letter following his defeat in the 1830 elections, as quoted in David Crockett: The Man and the Legend (1994)

“I am at liberty to vote as my conscience and judgment dictates to be right, without the yoke of any party on me, or the driver at my heels, with his whip in hand, commanding me to ge-wo-haw, just at his pleasure. Look at my arms, you will find no party hand-cuff on them!” Letter from 28 January, 1834, reported in A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett

“I am no man’s man. I bark at no man’s bid. I will never come and go, and fetch and carry, at the whistle of the great man in the white house, no matter who he is.” An Account of Col. Crockett’s Tour to the North and Down East (1835)

When Crockett was defeated again in 1835, he gave up on politics and made way for Texas (then the Mexican state of Tejas). Still, he can at least say that he always stood up for what he thought was right.

On Survival in the Frontier

There’s a reason Davy Crockett is known as the “King of the Wild Frontier.” One of those reasons is the 1955 song “The Ballad of Davy Crockett” by Tom W. Blackburn, but the other reason is because he was one heck of a hunter. When he wasn’t fighting wars or running for office, hunting bears is how he made a living. He claims to have killed 105 bears in a seven-month period during the harsh winter of 1825-26. Whoa. So, whether he was lost in the woods:

“For the information of young hunters, I will just say, in this place, that whenever a fellow gets bad lost, the way home is just the way he don’t think it is. This rule will hit nine times out of ten.”

Or freezing his butt off in the cold:



“I suffered very much that night with cold, as my leather breeches, and every thing else I had on, was wet and frozen. But I managed to get my bear out of this crack after several hard trials, and so I butchered him, and laid down to try to sleep. But my fire was very bad, and I couldn’t find any thing that would burn well to make it any better; and I concluded I should freeze, if I didn’t warm myself in some way by exercise. So I got up, and hollered a while, and then I would just jump up and down with all my might, and throw myself into all sorts of motions. But all this wouldn’t do; for my blood was now getting cold, and the chills coming all over me. I was so tired, too, that I could hardly walk; but I thought I would do the best I could to save my life, and then, if I died, nobody would be to blame. So I went to a tree about two feet through, and not a limb on it for thirty feet, and I would climb up it to the limbs, and then lock my arms together around it, and slide down to the bottom again. This would make the insides of my legs and arms feel mighty warm and good. I continued this till daylight in the morning, and how often I clomb up my tree and slid down I don’t know, but I reckon at least a hundred times.” A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett of the State of Tennessee (1834)

Ah, the warming power of friction. The King of the Wild Frontier always knew what to do.

On Being Humble

Davy Crockett was a pretty big deal even while he was alive, but he never let any of the attention get to his head. In fact, he didn’t really understand what the fuss was all about.

“I know, that obscure as I am, my name is making a considerable deal of fuss in the world. I can’t tell why it is, nor in what it is to end. Go where I will, everybody seems anxious to get a peep at me … There must therefore be something in me, or about me, that attracts attention, which is even mysterious to myself.” A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett (1834)

He was kind of an early 19th-century version of Chuck Norris jokes. Despite all that, he stayed pretty down to earth.



On Helping People

One of the reasons people liked Davy Crockett so much is because he was always willing to help. Whether they were a neighbor in need of food for the winter:

“I worked on with my hands till the bears got fat, and then I turned out to hunting, to lay in a supply of meat. I soon killed and salted down as many as were necessary for my family; but about this time one of my old neighbours, who had settled down on the lake about twenty-five miles from me, came to my house and told me he wanted me to go down and kill some bears about in his parts. He said they were extremely fat, and very plenty. I know’d that when they were fat, they were easily taken, for a fat bear can’t run fast or long. But I asked a bear no favours, no way, further than civility, for I now had eight large dogs, and as fierce as painters; so that a bear stood no chance at all to get away from them. So I went home with him, and then went on down towards the Mississippi, and commenced hunting. We were out two weeks, and in that time killed fifteen bears. Having now supplied my friend with plenty of meat, I engaged occasionally again with my hands in our boat building and getting staves.” A NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF DAVID CROCKETT OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE (1834)

Or a random poor soul on the street:



“Whenever I had anything, and saw a fellow-being suffering, I was more anxious to relieve him than to benefit myself. And this is one of the true secrets of my being a poor man to this day. But it is my way, and while it has often left me an empty purse, yet it has never left my heart empty of consolations which money couldn’t buy, the consolation of having sometimes fed the hungry and covered the naked.” Davy Crockett (1918)

Crockett just wanted to do the right thing, even if it meant he would have less.



On Trying Something New

Crockett eventually tried his hand at poetry because, well, why not? He was sad and wanted to get those feelings out.

“Sorrow, it is said, will make even an oyster feel poetical. I never tried my hand at that sort of writing but on this particular occasion such was my state of feeling, that I began to fancy myself inspired; so I took pen in hand, and as usual I went ahead.” Col. Crockett’s Exploits and Adventures in Texas (1836)

Here’s one of his poems:

The corn that I planted, the fields that I cleared, The flocks that I raised, and the cabin I reared; The wife of my bosom — Farewell to ye all! In the land of the stranger I rise or I fall.

Not bad for a guy who went to school for a grand total of about four days before running away to start a life of adventure. Don’t let things stand in your way if you want to try something new. Be like Davy and just give it a go!



On Knowing When to Throw in the Towel

After running for Congress for the fourth time and losing for the second time in 1835, Crockett was pretty disheartened. So, he decided it was best to call it quits and move on to greener pastures.

“I also told them of the manner in which I had been knocked down and dragged out, and that I didn’t consider it a fair fight any how they could fix it. I put the ingredients in the cup pretty strong I tell you, and I concluded my speech by telling them that I was done with politics for the present, and they might all go to hell, and I would go to Texas.” Col. Crockett’s Exploits and Adventures in Texas (1836)

He certainly went out with a bang. Unfortunately for Crockett, he’d only get to spend three months in Texas before he would be killed at the Battle of the Alamo in 1836.



On Life

Crockett’s exploits were many, and it’s hard to tell the difference between fact and tall tale, but he certainly seemed to live well. That was partly thanks to his number one rule:

“I leave this rule for others when I’m dead. Be always sure you’re right — THEN GO AHEAD!” David Crockett: His Life and Adventures (1874)

Simple but effective, no? Lastly, he knew that he wanted to be known for the way he lived, not how he died:

“I know not whether, in the eyes of the world, a brilliant death is not preferred to an obscure life of rectitude. Most men are remembered as they died, and not as they lived. We gaze with admiration upon the glories of the setting sun, yet scarcely bestow a passing glance upon its noonday splendor.” David Crockett: His Life and Adventures, 1875

It’s not a bad way to look at your own life. Will you just be an obituary, a date in someone’s mind? Or will you leave behind the things you did while you lived?

Identical messages often showed up within minutes of each other, hinting at tight coordination. And those posts that didn't fit the pattern typically came from accounts that were bent on manipulating social tensions, such as Black Lives Matter protests and Texas' secession movement.

And as illustrated earlier, some of these accounts got plenty of attention. One account for a fake conservative Texan woman amassed roughly 70,000 followers, including Lt. Gen Michael Flynn and Sean Hannity.

The WSJ warns that its ability to measure the full timeline is limited: as Twitter removes tweets the moment it suspends an account, it's difficult to go back and see every post. It's possible that the initiative started earlier or had different ratios. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that Russia's social influence campaign favored Trump right from the start, well before it was clear how he would fare in the Republican primaries or the general election."

The language of the tweet certainly doesn't suggest that an American first strike is imminent. However, this is the first time the North has used an internet post as a pretext for its bluster.

Also, the incident underscores the problems that can arise when political leaders post to social networks without any filters. Even an off-hand comment can spark a diplomatic row, and walking it back might not be as simple as deleting the tweet or issuing a quick apology."

The leaders hail from companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and GM. Ivanka told reporters, ""Given the growing role of technology in American industry, it is vital our students become fluent in coding and computer science, with early exposure to both.""

While previous administrations and Congress have pushed to expand computer science education, as have a number of tech giants, the relationship between Trump and the tech industry is currently on shaky ground. Hundreds of tech CEOs and leaders voiced their dissent over the president's move to dissolve DACA and dozens left his advisory councils after his weak response to the violence in Charlottesville.

The money Trump has asked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to use towards expanding computer science education isn't additional money for the department to use, but is rather a request to redirect current funds in a way that prioritizes STEM and computer science. Where that money will be pulled from remains to be seen, but with around just 40 percent of schools currently teaching computer programming, it would be good if this push had some success.

Update: The New York Times has reported that tech companies have pledged $300 million to the Trump administration's K-12 computer science education initiative. Internet Association member companies will provide the money over the course of five years with Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce each pledging $50 million, Lockheed Martin committing $25 million and Accenture, GM and Pluralsight donating $10 million each. Some companies will also provide software."

""Although the warrants claim to seek only evidence in support of the government's prosecutions of January 20 demonstrations, they demand—among other things—all private messages, friend lists, status updates, comments, photos, video, and other private information solely intended for the users' Facebook friends and family, even if they have nothing to do with Inauguration Day. The warrants also seek information about actions taken on Facebook, including all searches performed by the users, groups or networks joined, and all ""data and information that has been deleted by the user.""""

The ACLU's issue with the DOJ's Facebook page-related warrant is a little more intricate. Sure, anyone could find out who was on a public group's list of followers, but Facebook would be divulging info on users who simply interacted with the page. In the ACLU's words, ""Although the page is public, the warrant would require the disclosure of non-public lists of people who planned to attend political organizing events and even the names of people who simply liked, followed, reacted to, commented on, or otherwise engaged with the content on the Facebook page. During the three-month span the search warrant covers, approximately 6,000 Facebook users liked the page.""

Folks first found out about the DOJ's requests to Facebook when the social network fought back on a gag order that prevented them from informing the three users targeted by the investigation. While the DOJ rescinded the order, they still required the information. Likewise, the department gave up on its request for the IP of 1.3 million visitors to DisruptJ20.com, but served an amended warrant to the site's host the next day. In this round of overreach, the ACLU is requesting the DOJ rescind, or amend, its warrants.

Update: Here's Facebook's official comment:

""We successfully fought in court to be able to notify the three people whose broad account information was requested by the government. We are grateful to the companies and civil society organizations that supported us in arguing for people's ability to learn about and challenge overly broad search warrants,"" said a Facebook spokesperson."
